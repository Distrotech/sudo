.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm sudo
allows a permitted user to execute a
.Ar command
as the superuser or another user, as specified by the security
policy.
.Pp
.Nm sudo
supports a plugin architecture for security policies and input/output
logging.
Third parties can develop and distribute their own policy and I/O
logging plugins to work seamlessly with the
.Nm sudo
front end.
The default security policy is
.Em sudoers ,
which is configured via the file
.Pa @sysconfdir@/sudoers ,
or via LDAP.
See the
.Sx Plugins
section for more information.
.Pp
The security policy determines what privileges, if any, a user has
to run
.Nm sudo .
The policy may require that users authenticate themselves with a
password or another authentication mechanism.
If authentication is required,
.Nm sudo
will exit if the user's password is not entered within a configurable
time limit.
This limit is policy-specific; the default password prompt timeout
for the
.Em sudoers
security policy is
.Li @password_timeout@
minutes.
.Pp
Security policies may support credential caching to allow the user
to run
.Nm sudo
again for a period of time without requiring authentication.
The
.Em sudoers
policy caches credentials for
.Li @timeout@
minutes, unless overridden in
.Xr sudoers @mansectform@ .
By running
.Nm sudo
with the
.Fl v
option, a user can update the cached credentials without running a
.Ar command .
.Pp
When invoked as
.Nm sudoedit ,
the
.Fl e
option (described below), is implied.
.Pp
Security policies may log successful and failed attempts to use
.Nm sudo .
If an I/O plugin is configured, the running command's input and
output may be logged as well.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Fl A
Normally, if
.Nm sudo
requires a password, it will read it from the user's terminal.
If the
.Fl A No ( Em askpass Ns No )
option is specified, a (possibly graphical) helper program is
executed to read the user's password and output the password to the
standard output.
If the
.Ev SUDO_ASKPASS
environment variable is set, it specifies the path to the helper
program.
Otherwise, if
.Xr sudo.conf @mansectform@
contains a line specifying the askpass program, that value will be
used.
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset 4n
# Path to askpass helper program
Path askpass /usr/X11R6/bin/ssh-askpass
.Ed
.Pp
If no askpass program is available,
.Nm sudo
will exit with an error.
.It Fl a Ar type
The
.Fl a No ( Em "authentication type" Ns No )
option causes
.Nm sudo
to use the specified authentication type when validating the user,
as allowed by
.Pa /etc/login.conf .
The system administrator may specify a list of sudo-specific
authentication methods by adding an
.Dq auth-sudo
entry in
.Pa /etc/login.conf .
This option is only available on systems that support BSD authentication.
.It Fl b
The
.Fl b No ( Em background Ns No )
option tells
.Nm sudo
to run the given command in the background.
Note that if you use the
.Fl b
option you cannot use shell job control to manipulate the process.
Most interactive commands will fail to work properly in background
mode.
.It Fl C Ar fd
Normally,
.Nm sudo
will close all open file descriptors other than standard input,
standard output and standard error.
The
.Fl C No ( Em close from Ns No )
option allows the user to specify a starting point above the standard
error (file descriptor three).
Values less than three are not permitted.
The security policy may restrict the user's ability to use the
.Fl C
option.
The
.Em sudoers
policy only permits use of the
.Fl C
option when the administrator has enabled the
.Em closefrom_override
option.
.It Fl c Ar class
The
.Fl c No ( Em class Ns No )
option causes
.Nm sudo
to run the specified command with resources limited by the specified
login class.
The
.Em class
argument can be either a class name as defined in
.Pa /etc/login.conf ,
or a single
.Ql \-
character.
Specifying a
.Ar class
of
.Li -
indicates that the command should be run restricted by the default
login capabilities for the user the command is run as.
If the
.Ar class
argument specifies an existing user class, the command must be run
as root, or the
.Nm sudo
command must be run from a shell that is already root.
This option is only available on systems with BSD login classes.
.It Fl E
The
.Fl E No ( Em preserve environment Ns No )
option indicates to the security policy that the user wishes to
preserve their existing environment variables.
The security policy may return an error if the
.Fl E
option is specified and the user does not have permission to preserve
the environment.
.It Fl e
The
.Fl e No ( Em edit Ns No )
option indicates that, instead of running a command, the user wishes
to edit one or more files.
In lieu of a command, the string "sudoedit" is used when consulting
the security policy.
If the user is authorized by the policy, the following steps are
taken:
.Bl -enum -offset 4
.It
Temporary copies are made of the files to be edited with the owner
set to the invoking user.
.It
The editor specified by the policy is run to edit the temporary
files.
The
.Em sudoers
policy uses the
.Ev SUDO_EDITOR ,
.Ev VISUAL
and
.Ev EDITOR
environment variables (in that order).
If none of
.Ev SUDO_EDITOR ,
.Ev VISUAL
or
.Ev EDITOR
are set, the first program listed in the
.Em editor
.Xr sudoers @mansectform@
option is used.
.It
If they have been modified, the temporary files are copied back to
their original location and the temporary versions are removed.
.El
.Pp
If the specified file does not exist, it will be created.
Note that unlike most commands run by
.Em sudo ,
the editor is run with the invoking user's environment unmodified.
If, for some reason,
.Nm sudo
is unable to update a file with its edited version, the user will
receive a warning and the edited copy will remain in a temporary
file.
.It Fl g Ar group
Normally,
.Nm sudo
runs a command with the primary group set to the one specified by
the password database for the user the command is being run as (by
default, root).
The
.Fl g No ( Em group Ns No )
option causes
.Nm sudo
to run the command with the primary group set to
.Ar group
instead.
To specify a
.Em gid
instead of a
.Em "group name" ,
use
.Em #gid .
When running commands as a
.Em gid ,
many shells require that the
.Ql #
be escaped with a backslash
.Pq Ql \e .
If no
.Fl u
option is specified, the command will be run as the invoking user
(not root).
In either case, the primary group will be set to
.Em group .
.It Fl H
The
.Fl H No ( Em HOME Ns No )
option requests that the security policy set the
.Ev HOME
environment variable to the home directory of the target user (root
by default) as specified by the password database.
Depending on the policy, this may be the default behavior.
.It Fl h
The
.Fl h No ( Em help Ns No )
option causes
.Nm sudo
to print a short help message to the standard output and exit.
.It Fl i Op Ar command
The
.Fl i No ( Em simulate initial login Ns No )
option runs the shell specified by the password database entry of
the target user as a login shell.
This means that login-specific resource files such as
.Pa .profile
or
.Pa .login
will be read by the shell.
If a command is specified, it is passed to the shell for execution
via the shell's
.Fl c
option.
If no command is specified, an interactive shell is executed.
.Nm sudo
attempts to change to that user's home directory before running the
shell.
The security policy shall initialize the environment to a minimal
set of variables, similar to what is present when a user logs in.
The
.Em Command Environment
section in the
.Xr sudoers @mansectform@
manual documents how the
.Fl i
option affects the environment in which a command is run when the
.Em sudoers
policy is in use.
.It Fl K
The
.Fl K No ( sure Em kill Ns No )
option is like
.Fl k
except that it removes the user's cached credentials entirely and
may not be used in conjunction with a command or other option.
This option does not require a password.
Not all security policies support credential caching.
.It Fl k Op Ar command
When used alone, the
.Fl k No ( Em kill Ns No )
option to
.Nm sudo
invalidates the user's cached credentials.
The next time
.Nm sudo
is run a password will be required.
This option does not require a password and was added to allow a
user to revoke
.Nm sudo
permissions from a
.Pa .logout
file.
Not all security policies support credential caching.
.Pp
When used in conjunction with a command or an option that may require
a password, the
.Fl k
option will cause
.Nm sudo
to ignore the user's cached credentials.
As a result,
.Nm sudo
will prompt for a password (if one is required by the security
policy) and will not update the user's cached credentials.
.It Fl l Ns Oo Sy l Oc Op Ar command
If no
.Ar command
is specified, the
.Fl l No ( Em list Ns No )
option will list the allowed (and forbidden) commands for the
invoking user (or the user specified by the
.Fl U
option) on the current host.
If a
.Ar command
is specified and is permitted by the security policy, the fully-qualified
path to the command is displayed along with any command line
arguments.
If
.Ar command
is specified but not allowed,
.Nm sudo
will exit with a status value of 1.
If the
.Fl l
option is specified with an
.Ar l
argument
.Pq i.e.\& Fl ll ,
or if
.Fl l
is specified multiple times, a longer list format is used.
.It Fl n
The
.Fl n No ( Em non-interactive Ns No )
option prevents
.Nm sudo
from prompting the user for a password.
If a password is required for the command to run,
.Nm sudo
will display an error message and exit.
.It Fl P
The
.Fl P No ( Em preserve group vector Ns No )
option causes
.Nm sudo
to preserve the invoking user's group vector unaltered.
By default, the
.Em sudoers
policy will initialize the group vector to the list of groups the
target user is in.
The real and effective group IDs, however, are still set to match
the target user.
.It Fl p Ar prompt
The
.Fl p No ( Em prompt Ns No )
option allows you to override the default password prompt and use
a custom one.
The following percent
.Pq Ql %
escapes are supported by the
.Em sudoers
policy:
.Bl -tag -width 2n
.It Li %H
expanded to the host name including the domain name (on if the
machine's host name is fully qualified or the
.Em fqdn
option is set in
.Xr sudoers @mansectform@ )
.It Li %h
expanded to the local host name without the domain name
.It Li %p
expanded to the name of the user whose password is being requested
(respects the
.Em rootpw ,
.Em targetpw ,
and
.Em runaspw
flags in
.Xr sudoers @mansectform@ )
.It Li \&%U
expanded to the login name of the user the command will be run as
(defaults to root unless the
.Fl u
option is also specified)
.It Li %u
expanded to the invoking user's login name
.It Li %%
two consecutive
.Ql %
characters are collapsed into a single
.Ql %
character
.El
.Pp
The prompt specified by the
.Fl p
option will override the system password prompt on systems that
support PAM unless the
.Em passprompt_override
flag is disabled in
.Em sudoers .
.It Fl r Ar role
The
.Fl r No ( Em role Ns No )
option causes the new (SELinux) security context to have the role
specified by
.Ar role .
.It Fl S
The
.Fl S ( Em stdin Ns No )
option causes
.Nm sudo
to read the password from the standard input instead of the terminal
device.
The password must be followed by a newline character.
.It Fl s Op Ar command
The
.Fl s ( Em shell Ns No )
option runs the shell specified by the
.Ev SHELL
environment variable if it is set or the shell as specified in the
password database.
If a command is specified, it is passed to the shell for execution
via the shell's
.Fl c
option.
If no command is specified, an interactive shell is executed.
.It Fl t Ar type
The
.Fl t ( Em type Ns No )
option causes the new (SELinux) security context to have the type
specified by
.Ar type .
If no type is specified, the default type is derived from the
specified role.
.It Fl U Ar user
The
.Fl U ( Em other user Ns No )
option is used in conjunction with the
.Fl l
option to specify the user whose privileges should be listed.
The security policy may restrict listing other users' privileges.
The
.Em sudoers
policy only allows root or a user with the
.Li ALL
privilege on the current host to use this option.
.It Fl u Ar user
The
.Fl u ( Em user Ns No )
option causes
.Nm sudo
to run the specified command as a user other than
.Em root .
To specify a
.Em uid
instead of a
.Em user name ,
.Em #uid .
When running commands as a
.Em uid ,
many shells require that the
.Ql #
be escaped with a backslash
.Pq Ql \e .
Security policies may restrict
.Em uid Ns No s
to those listed in the password database.
The
.Em sudoers
policy allows
.Em uid Ns No s
that are not in the password database as long as the
.Em targetpw
option is not set.
Other security policies may not support this.
.It Fl V
The
.Fl V ( Em version Ns No )
option causes
.Nm sudo
to print its version string and the version string of the security
policy plugin and any I/O plugins.
If the invoking user is already root the
.Fl V
option will display the arguments passed to configure when
.Nm sudo
was built and plugins may display more verbose information such as
default options.
.It Fl v
When given the
.Fl v ( Em validate Ns No )
option,
.Nm sudo
will update the user's cached credentials, authenticating the user's
password if necessary.
For the
.Em sudoers
plugin, this extends the
.Nm sudo
timeout for another
.Li @timeout@
minutes (or whatever the timeout is set to by the security policy)
but does not run a command.
Not all security policies support cached credentials.
.It Fl -
The
.Fl -
option indicates that
.Nm sudo
should stop processing command line arguments.
.El
.Pp
Environment variables to be set for the command may also be passed
on the command line in the form of
.Sy VAR Ns No = Ns Em value ,
e.g.\&
.Sy LD_LIBRARY_PATH Ns No = Ns Em /usr/local/pkg/lib .
Variables passed on the command line are subject to the same
restrictions as normal environment variables with one important
exception.
If the
.Em setenv
option is set in
.Em sudoers ,
the command to be run has the
.Li SETENV
tag set or the command matched is
.Li ALL ,
the user may set variables that would otherwise be forbidden.
See
.Xr sudoers @mansectform@
for more information.
.Sh COMMAND EXECUTION
When
.Nm sudo
executes a command, the security policy specifies the execution
environment for the command.
Typically, the real and effective uid and gid are set to
match those of the target user, as specified in the password database,
and the group vector is initialized based on the group database
(unless the
.Fl P
option was specified).
.Pp
The following parameters may be specified by security policy:
.Bl -bullet
.It
real and effective user ID
.It
real and effective group ID
.It
supplementary group IDs
.It
the environment list
.It
current working directory
.It
file creation mode mask (umask)
.It
SELinux role and type
.It
Solaris project
.It
Solaris privileges
.It
BSD login class
.It
scheduling priority (aka nice value)
.El
.Ss Process model
When
.Nm sudo
runs a command, it calls
.Xr fork 2 ,
sets up the execution environment as described above, and calls the
.Xr execve
system call in the child process.
The main
.Nm sudo
process waits until the command has completed, then passes the
command's exit status to the security policy's close function and exits.
If an I/O logging plugin is configured or if the security policy
explicitly requests it, a new  pseudo-terminal
.Pq Dq pty
is created and a second
.Nm sudo
process is used to relay job control signals between the user's
existing pty and the new pty the command is being run in.
This extra process makes it possible to, for example, suspend
and resume the command.
Without it, the command would be in what POSIX terms an
.Dq orphaned process group
and it would not receive any job control signals.
As a special case, if the policy plugin does not define a close
function and no pty is required,
.Nm sudo
will execute the command directly instead of calling
.Xr fork 2
first.
.Ss Signal handling
Because the command is run as a child of the
.Nm sudo
process,
.Nm sudo
will relay signals it receives to the command.
Unless the command is being run in a new pty, the
.Dv SIGHUP ,
.Dv SIGINT
and
.Dv SIGQUIT
signals are not relayed unless they are sent by a user process,
not the kernel.
Otherwise, the command would receive
.Dv SIGINT
twice every time the user entered control-C.
Some signals, such as
.Dv SIGSTOP
and
.Dv SIGKILL ,
cannot be caught and thus will not be relayed to the command.
As a general rule,
.Dv SIGTSTP
should be used instead of
.Dv SIGSTOP
when you wish to suspend a command being run by
.Nm sudo .
.Pp
As a special case,
.Nm sudo
will not relay signals that were sent by the command it is running.
This prevents the command from accidentally killing itself.
On some systems, the
.Xr reboot @mansectsu@
command sends
.Dv SIGTERM
to all non-system processes other than itself before rebooting
the system.
This prevents
.Nm sudo
from relaying the
.Dv SIGTERM
signal it received back to
.Xr reboot @mansectsu@ ,
which might then exit before the system was actually rebooted,
leaving it in a half-dead state similar to single user mode.
Note, however, that this check only applies to the command run by
.Nm sudo
and not any other processes that the command may create.
As a result, running a script that calls
.Xr reboot @mansectsu@
or
.Xr shutdown @mansectsu@
via
.Nm sudo
may cause the system to end up in this undefined state unless the
.Xr reboot @mansectsu@
or
.Xr shutdown @mansectsu@
are run using the
.Fn exec
family of functions instead of
.Fn system
(which interposes a shell between the command and the calling process).
.Pp
If no I/O logging plugins are loaded and the policy plugin has not
defined a
.Fn close
function, set a command timeout or required that the command be
run in a new pty,
.Nm sudo
may execute the command directly instead of running it as a child process.
.Ss Plugins
Plugins are dynamically loaded based on the contents of the
.Xr sudo.conf @mansectform@
file.
If no
.Xr sudo.conf @mansectform@
file is present, or it contains no
.Li Plugin
lines,
.Nm sudo
will use the traditional
.Em sudoers
security policy and I/O logging.
See the
.Xr sudo.conf @mansectform@
manual for details of the
.Pa @sysconfdir@/sudo.conf
file and the
.Xr sudo_plugin @mansectsu@
manual for more information about the
.Nm sudo
plugin architecture.
.Sh EXIT VALUE
Upon successful execution of a program, the exit status from
.Em sudo
will simply be the exit status of the program that was executed.
.Pp
Otherwise,
.Nm sudo
exits with a value of 1 if there is a configuration/permission
problem or if
.Nm sudo
cannot execute the given command.
In the latter case the error string is printed to the standard error.
If
.Nm sudo
cannot
.Xr stat 2
one or more entries in the user's
.Ev PATH ,
an error is printed on stderr.
(If the directory does not exist or if it is not really a directory,
the entry is ignored and no error is printed.)
This should not happen under normal circumstances.
The most common reason for
.Xr stat 2
to return
.Dq permission denied
is if you are running an automounter and one of the directories in
your
.Ev PATH
is on a machine that is currently unreachable.
.Sh SECURITY NOTES
.Nm sudo
tries to be safe when executing external commands.
.Pp
To prevent command spoofing,
.Nm sudo
checks "." and "" (both denoting current directory) last when
searching for a command in the user's
.Ev PATH
(if one or both are in the
.Ev PATH ) .
Note, however, that the actual
.Ev PATH
environment variable is
.Em not
modified and is passed unchanged to the program that
.Nm sudo
executes.
.Pp
Please note that
.Nm sudo
will normally only log the command it explicitly runs.
If a user runs a command such as
.Li sudo su
or
.Li sudo sh ,
subsequent commands run from that shell are not subject to
.Nm sudo Ns No 's
security policy.
The same is true for commands that offer shell escapes (including
most editors).
If I/O logging is enabled, subsequent commands will have their input and/or
output logged, but there will not be traditional logs for those commands.
Because of this, care must be taken when giving users access to commands via
.Nm sudo
to verify that the command does not inadvertently give the user an
effective root shell.
For more information, please see the
.Em PREVENTING SHELL ESCAPES
section in
.Xr sudoers @mansectform@ .
.Pp
To prevent the disclosure of potentially sensitive information,
.Nm sudo
disables core dumps by default while it is executing (they are
re-enabled for the command that is run).
To aid in debugging
.Nm sudo
crashes, you may wish to re-enable core dumps by setting
.Dq disable_coredump
to false in the
.Xr sudo.conf @mansectform@
file as follows:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
Set disable_coredump false
.Ed
.Pp
See the
.Xr sudo.conf @mansectform@
manual for more information.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Nm sudo
utilizes the following environment variables.
The security policy has control over the actual content of the command's
environment.
.Bl -tag -width 15n

.Sh CAVEATS
There is no easy way to prevent a user from gaining a root shell
if that user is allowed to run arbitrary commands via
.Nm sudo .
Also, many programs (such as editors) allow the user to run commands
via shell escapes, thus avoiding
.Nm sudo Ns No 's
checks.
However, on most systems it is possible to prevent shell escapes with the
.Xr sudoers @mansectform@
plugin's
.Em noexec
functionality.
.Pp
It is not meaningful to run the
.Li cd
command directly via sudo, e.g.,
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ sudo cd /usr/local/protected
.Ed
.Pp
since when the command exits the parent process (your shell) will
still be the same.
Please see the
.Sx EXAMPLES
section for more information.
.Pp
Running shell scripts via
.Nm sudo
can expose the same kernel bugs that make setuid shell scripts
unsafe on some operating systems (if your OS has a /dev/fd/ directory,
setuid shell scripts are generally safe).
